    "# Text Generation with DeepSeek Coder\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goal:** Fine-tune a DeepSeek Coder model (specifically, an instruction-tuned variant) to generate text based on given instructions or prompts. This demonstrates a practical application of LLMs for tasks beyond simple text continuation.  We'll focus on generating short code snippets or explanations based on instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset:** We'll create a small dataset of instruction-response pairs. The instructions will describe a simple programming task or concept, and the responses will be the corresponding code or explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Python:** The programming language.\n",
    "*   **Hugging Face Transformers:** For accessing and using pre-trained LLMs.\n",

    "        *   **Crucially**, we format the input for *instruction tuning*.  We prepend a specific prompt format (`### Instruction:\\n ... \\n\\n### Response:\\n`) to each instruction. This tells the model what is the instruction and what is the expected response.\n",
    "        * We add the `eos_token` (End Of Sequence) to the `response` part.\n",
    "        * We include a `max_length` parameter in the tokenization.\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   **Key Changes:**\n",
    "        *   We often use a smaller `per_device_train_batch_size` (even 1) with DeepSeek models, especially on less powerful GPUs.\n",
    "        *   We use `gradient_accumulation_steps` to effectively increase the batch size without using more GPU memory.  This simulates a larger batch size by accumulating gradients over multiple forward/backward passes.\n",
    "        *   We enable `fp16=True` (mixed precision) if your GPU supports it (most modern GPUs do). This significantly reduces memory usage and can speed up training.\n",

    "*   **Resource Management:** The code is optimized for smaller GPUs or even CPU usage (although a GPU is still highly recommended for faster training). We use techniques like mixed precision (`fp16`) and gradient accumulation to reduce memory requirements.\n",
    "*   **Clear Input Formatting:** The code clearly demonstrates the importance of proper input formatting for instruction-tuned models.\n",
    "* **AutoClasses:** Using `AutoModel` and `AutoTokenizer`.\n",
    "* **Complete and Runnable:** The code is complete, runnable, and well-commented, making it easy to understand and adapt.\n",
    "* **Clear Prompt and Response Extraction:** The final text generation step clearly separates the prompt and response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This revised capstone project provides a practical and accessible introduction to using a smaller, instruction-tuned LLM for a more specific task. It highlights the importance of proper input formatting and resource management when working with these powerful models. You can now build upon this foundation to explore more complex tasks and larger datasets. Remember to consult the Hugging Face documentation for detailed information on the DeepSeek models and the `transformers` library.\n"
